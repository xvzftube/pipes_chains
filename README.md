# The opinionated way to manipulate dataframes
---

The point is that data manipulation is better when it is more human readable. 

This repo contains code and data to show how to use chaining in sqlite, julia, R, and Python. I did not have to stop there. I could have also shown how this works in Scala/Spark and other dialects of SQL. This is just enough to present the ideas in enough variety so you can apply the idea in environment which may be different from the ones I have shown.
